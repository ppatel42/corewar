Neo: ....

Agent Smith: Mister Anderson! Did you get my package?
10587<
Neo: Yeah.
11613<
Agent Smith: Well, good.
13897<
(Radio) Morpheus: ...Smith. (Radio) Link: Whoever it is, he's not reading like an agent.
16923<
Agent Smith: Surprised to see me?
18829<
Neo: No.
21319<
Agent Smith: Then you're aware of it.
22586<
Neo: Of what?
24409<
Agent Smith: Our connection. I don't fully understand how it happened.
29926<
Agent Smith: Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied.
36305<
Agent Smith: That is at this point irrelevant, what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.
42167<
Neo: And what reason is that?
44384<
Agent Smith: I killed you, Mister Anderson, I watched you die...
48275<
Agent Smith: With a certain satisfaction, I might add, and then something happened.
53670<
Agent Smith: Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway.
58251<
Agent Smith: You destroyed me, Mister Anderson.
63423<
Agent Smith: Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn't.
71423<
Agent Smith: I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey.
80147<
Agent Smith: And now here I stand because of you, Mister Anderson, because of you I'm no longer an agent of the system,
88127<
Agent Smith: because of you I've changed - I'm unplugged - a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free.
96477<
Neo: Congratulations.
98620<
Agent Smith: Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving,
106762<
Agent Smith: which brings me back to the reason why we're here.
111625<
Agent Smith: We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free.
116797<
Agent Smith: There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose,
121157<
Agent Smith: because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.
126157<
Agent Smith: It is purpose that created us,
129482<
Agent Smith: Purpose that connects us,
131230<
Agent Smith: Purpose that pulls us,
132684<
Agent Smith: That guides us,
133472<
Agent Smith: That drives us,
134629<
Agent Smith: It is purpose that defines,
137437<
Agent Smith: Purpose that binds us.
139383<
Agent Smith: We're here because of you, Mister Anderson,
142560<
Agent Smith: we're here to take from you what you tried to take from us.
146834<
Neo: UUURGH!
148398<
Agent Smith: Purpose.
153693<
(Radio) Trinity: What's happening to him? (Radio) Link: I don't know.
155645<
Neo: ...
158521<
Agent Smith: Yes, that's it, it'll be over soon.
